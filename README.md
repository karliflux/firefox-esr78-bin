<p>1: clone the source code to your pc, by typing in git clone then the path to the repository you want to clone, like this</p>
<p>     # git clone https://github.com/sleepykitteh-4314/firefox-esr78-bin.git</p>
<p>2: changing into the directory of the newly downloaded repository</p>
<p>     # cd firefox-esr78-bin</p>
<p>3: installing or compiling the now cloned repository</p>
<p>     # makepkg -si</p>
